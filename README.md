# Homework-04

As described in the [Homework Text](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/tree/master/Homework_4), we had to analyze two different datasets both coming from the following [link](https://www.immobiliare.it/vendita-case/roma/?criterio=rilevanza&pag=1). Immobiliare.it is one of the biggest place in Italy where you can find houses to rent or to buy(and also it is one of the partners of our degree here in Sapienza).

You can find two different files in our directory:

- NAME: .ipynb file in which you can find the web scraping part with the clustering and the wordcloud graph.

- NAME: .ipynb file with the code(commented) for the Find the duplicates part.
